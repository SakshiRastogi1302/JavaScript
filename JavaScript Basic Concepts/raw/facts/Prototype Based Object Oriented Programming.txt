2. Class based object oriented programming language is a style of Object-oriented programming (OOP) in which 
   inheritance occurs via defining classes of objects, instead of inheritance occurring via the objects alone.

4. let names = {
    fname: "Dillion",
    lname: "Megida"
}
console.log(names.fname);
console.log(names.hasOwnProperty("mname"));
// Expected Output
// Dillion
// false

The object variable names has only two properties - fname and lname . No methods at all.

Ans. Methods are functions stored as object properties.
